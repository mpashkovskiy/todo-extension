# ToDo

This extension helps to form habits and prioritise tasks.

Inspired by: 
* [The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin by Benjamin Franklin](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/148) and the approach he described as a ["project of arriving at moral perfection"](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/148/148-h/148-h.htm#Page_82)
* and [Dwight D. Eisenhower's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method)

**Why does it replace Chrome's new tab page?**

If you are an engineer or a student you spend a lot of time searching for information and reading documentation online. "New Tab" in Chrome usually offers you most often visited pages which can "blur" your focus. To stay focused people install blank page extension, so it is possible to go even further and put on the page things you like to focus on.


## Habits

Benjamin Franklin spent [at least one week](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/148/148-h/148-h.htm#Page_86) developing a virtue, but according to [the research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674) by Phillippa Lally and colleagues from University College of London it takes from 18 to 254 days (66 days in average) to form a new habit, 

Others believes that it takes only 21 day.

Taking it all into account top panel were developed to contain about four weeks for tracking your habit development.


## Tasks

There are four quadrants on the tasks panel. They are placed accordingly to Dwight D. Eisenhower's Method:

|                   | Urgent                   | Not Urgent                    |
|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Important**     | Important and Urgent     | Important and Not Urgent      |
| **Not important** | Not Important and Urgent | Not Important and Not Urgent  |

There are two basic rules to manage tasks:

* Try to focus as much as possible on *Important and Not Urgent* because it affect you future the most.
* Try to delegate everything else.
